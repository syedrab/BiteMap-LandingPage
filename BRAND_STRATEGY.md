# BiteMap Brand & Marketing Strategy

## Brand Foundation

### Mission Statement
Connect food lovers with their next favorite spot through real people they can trust.

### Vision
Become the go-to platform where local food communities thrive—starting with Toronto, then every city.

### Core Value Proposition
**Trust through real people.** Not anonymous reviews. Not meaningless stars. Not scattered content. BiteMap connects you to real creators who show you real places you can actually visit.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: Gen Z & Millennials (18-35)
- **Behaviors**: Social-first, video-native, trust peer recommendations over ads
- **Pain Points**:
  - Yelp reviews feel fake/outdated
  - Google Maps stars are meaningless
  - TikTok food content is scattered with no map or action
- **Desires**: Authentic local spots, experiences worth sharing, community belonging

### Geographic Focus
**Toronto-first beachhead strategy**
- Launch and prove product-market fit in one city
- Build dense creator network before expanding
- Landing page should feel Toronto-rooted but not limiting

---

## Brand Personality

### Archetype: The Connector
Community-driven warmth (like Airbnb) with local authenticity.

### Brand Voice
| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Authentic** | Real talk, no corporate speak | "Your friend who knows all the spots" not "Discover dining experiences" |
| **Warm** | Welcoming, inclusive | "Join your city's food community" not "Download our app" |
| **Confident** | Bold but not arrogant | Make statements, don't ask permission |
| **Local** | Neighborhood feel | Reference real places, real creators |

### Tone Guidelines
- Use "you" and "your" — it's personal
- Avoid: "discover" (overused), "curated" (pretentious), "platform" (corporate)
- Embrace: "spot", "place", "find", "trust", "real", "your city"

## Positioning & Messaging

### The Problem (What We're Against)
> "Yelp has anonymous reviews that feel fake. Google has meaningless stars. TikTok has great food content but it's scattered everywhere with no map and no way to take action."

### The Solution (What We Offer)
> "BiteMap connects you to real creators you trust who show you real places you can actually go to. It's the difference between a stranger's 4-star review and your friend saying 'you HAVE to try this spot.'"

### Tagline Options
1. **"Real people. Real places. Your city."** (confident, complete)
2. **"Find your next spot through people you trust."** (benefit-focused)
3. **"Your city's food community."** (belonging)
4. **"Where foodies find their next spot."** (action-oriented)

### One-Liner (Elevator Pitch)
> "BiteMap is where you find your next favorite restaurant through short-form videos from local food creators you actually trust."

### Positioning Statement
For Gen Z and Millennial food lovers in Toronto who are tired of fake reviews and scattered content, BiteMap is a community-powered food discovery app that connects them with trusted local creators. Unlike Yelp, Google, or TikTok search, BiteMap combines authentic video content with an interactive map so you can actually take action on recommendations.
